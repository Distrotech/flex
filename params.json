{"name":"Flex","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.code.sf.net/p/flex/flex","body":"This is flex, the fast lexical analyzer generator.\r\n\r\nflex is a tool for generating scanners: programs which recognize\r\nlexical patterns in text.\r\n\r\nMore information about flex as well as the latest official release of\r\nflex can be found at:\r\n\r\nhttp://flex.sourceforge.net/\r\n\r\nBug reports should be submitted using the SourceForge Bug Tracker for\r\nflex at:\r\n\r\nhttp://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=97492&atid=618177\r\n\r\nThere are several mailing lists available as well:\r\n\r\nflex-announce@lists.sourceforge.net - where posts will be made\r\nannouncing new releases of flex.\r\n\r\nflex-help@lists.sourceforge.net - where you can post questions about\r\nusing flex\r\n\r\nflex-devel@lists.sourceforge.net - where you can discuss development of\r\nflex itself\r\n\r\nFind information on subscribing to the mailing lists at:\r\n\r\nhttp://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=97492\r\n\r\nThe flex distribution contains the following files which may be of interest:\r\n\r\nREADME - This file.\r\n\r\nNEWS - current version number and list of user-visible changes.\r\n\r\nINSTALL - basic installation information.\r\n\r\nABOUT-NLS - description of internationalization support in flex.\r\n\r\nCOPYING - flex's copyright and license.\r\n\r\ndoc/ - user documentation.\r\n\r\nexamples/ - containing examples of some possible flex scanners and a\r\nfew other things. See the file examples/README for more details.\r\n\r\nTODO - outstanding bug reports, desired features, etc.\r\n\r\ntests/ - regression tests. See TESTS/README for details.\r\n\r\npo/ - internationalization support files.\r\n\r\nThe flex codebase is kept in git at:\r\n\r\ngit://flex.git.sourceforge.net/gitrepos/flex/flex\r\n\r\nfor readonly access and:\r\n\r\nssh://username@flex.git.sourceforge.net/gitrepos/flex/flex\r\n\r\nfor read-write access, where \"username\" is your sourceforge username\r\nthat has ben granted write access to flex's git repository.\r\n\r\nYou need the following tools to build flex from the maintainer's\r\nrepository:\r\n\r\ncompiler suite - flex is built with gcc\r\nbash, or a good Bourne-style shell\r\nm4 - m4 -p needs to work; GNU m4 and a few others are suitable\r\nGNU bison;  to generate parse.c from parse.y\r\nautoconf 2.69; for handling the build system\r\nautomake 1.12.2; for Makefile generation\r\ngettext 0.18; fori18n support\r\nhelp2man 1.36; to generate the flex man page\r\ntar, gzip, etc.; for packaging of the source distribution\r\nGNU texinfo 498;  to build and test the flex manual\r\nGNU indent 2.8; for indenting the flex source the way we want it done\r\n\r\nOnce you have all the necessary tools installed, life becomes\r\nsimple. To prepare the flex tree for building, run the script:\r\n\r\n$ ./autogen.sh\r\n\r\nin the top level of the flex source tree.\r\nThis script calls the various tools needed to get flex ready for the\r\nGNU-style configure script to be able to work.\r\n\r\nFrom this point on, building flex follows the usual configure, make,\r\nmake install routine.\r\n\r\nThis file is part of flex.\r\n\r\nThis code is derived from software contributed to Berkeley by\r\nVern Paxson.\r\n\r\nThe United States Government has rights in this work pursuant\r\nto contract no.
